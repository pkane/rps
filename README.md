Serve your public/index.html via http to play the game. 

## Webpack dev server

The [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) is a little node.js Express server, which uses the webpack-dev-middleware to serve a webpack bundle. It also has a little runtime which is connected to the server via Socket.IO

Just run the server from the project root

`$ webpack-dev-server` or
`npm run dev-server`
